# Spiceful

## Description
- I picked a company named ”Spiceful”. I chose the name because I was making an application which will be having Indian recipes in it and as every knows Indian food is always spicy.
- The app has a list viewer in the vegetarian and non-vegetarian recipe page.
- The app will allow the user to adjust the font sizes as well the image size.
- For the custom hook I made a request page, inside it there’s a form where the user can enter the data and once submit button is pressed it will take the data from the app and will fill it in an email for user so that user can request for a new recipe.
- On contact us page I’ve added 5 option through which the user can contact me.
- On the credit page I’ve given the credits to all the people who’s images I’ve used in the app.

## Prerequisites
